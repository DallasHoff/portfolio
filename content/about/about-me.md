Skilled at learning new concepts quickly, planning ahead, and creative
thinking, I am a self-starter that loves to stay up to date on the
newest technologies and put them to use. I have been working in web
programming for over :years-experience years, learning,
building, and competing all the way. I am especially experienced with
JavaScript/TypeScript and developing interactive and user-friendly
interfaces.
